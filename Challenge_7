“From Packets to Access”

A company suspects that someone logged into their internal portal without authorization.

The only evidence available is a network capture file (.pcap).

The login page is still active.
The flag is inside.

Your mission:
Analyze the network traffic, uncover the stolen credentials, log into the system, and retrieve the hidden flag.

The packets already know the secret. You just have to listen.

Hint 1: Not all packets are noise. Some talk too much.
