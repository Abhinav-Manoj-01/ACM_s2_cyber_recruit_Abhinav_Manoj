Hey there!!
I think you have a quite good knowledge on html and its birth.
so find me??
the flag format is "flag{your_answer}"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decoding the base64 texts gives Part1 , Part2 etc. Did not get any flag from it.
Hint in question :  html and its birth , find me. Points to founder of html.
flag{tim_berners_lee}
or flag{part1_part2_part3_part4}
